    "**Answer 9:** At the end of the day, the performance of the linear and nonlinear decoders was pretty similar. Both networks were in the 90's for test set accuracy, though the nonlinear decoder was slightly higher. The main differnce between the networks is the speed in which the training happens. The nonlinear decoder trained faster than the linear decoder even though the nonlinear decoder took more epochs, meaning the linear coder was more computionally intensive. I don't have a particularly beefy computer, so the nonlinear was faster. If you have a high processing power computer, and you are willing to sacrifice some accuracy for a quicker training time, perhaps the linear decoder is the better option. While there were a few differences in the implementation of the two networks, neither one was way more difficult to code than the other. The only other major difference was the was the extra preprocessing step for the nonlinear decoder, but that was only required once and wasn't a problem at all. In the end, both networks are incredibly similar and it really comes down to one thing. Do you want to prioritize fewer slower epochs or more faster epochs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 10:** We were getting pretty good performance on both networks with the base hyperparameters. On the advice of Professor Layton, we increased the accuracy of the nonlinear decoder to 10, which resulted in ~5% bump in accuracy. However, this produce a validation loss graph that is trending slightly upward, so perhaps a slightly lower patience value could further increase performance. The linear decoder's validation loss is very erratic, so perhaps increasing the batch size could further increase its performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 11:** The nonlinear decoder requires significantly more iterations until the losses plateau. This might be because values falling outside of the steep region of the tanh function. This would cause different input samples to have similar outputs, preventing the network from quickly differentiating between samples."

    "The above uses a linear decoder and has identical hyperparameters to the network in 5b. However, this network uses the extra preprocessing step from 5c and applies the $ReLu^n$ function to the data before giving it to the network. I used the defualt value of $n=5$ for the first test. The result is an immediate jump to 96% accuracy on the test set, a 4% increases over 5b. Additionally, it didn't seem to affect the training time or loss curves. \n",

    "The $ReLu^n$ function significantly increases differentiation between positive values, but decreases differentiation between negative values. Obviously, the changes to the dataset help the network more than they hurt it. There were more positive weights than negative weights in the encoder net, so there are probably more positive values in the resulting encoded dataset. This would cause the benefit of increased differtiation on positive values to out-weigh to cons of setting all negative values to 0, since there just aren't that many negative values. The next question is if there is a value of $n$ that increases performance even more."

    "We used the above code to test several different values of $n$. When $n=10$, the net had an accuracy of 94% for some iteratins, which is better than the base net but worse thatn $n=5$, but this was not also consistent. We also tried a value of $n=1$, producing an accuracy of 64%. This is much worse than the original network. The network achieved a similar, low accuracy with $n=7$. It seems as though the effect of the nonlinear preprocessing is general unpredictable. However, some values of $n$ benefit the network, so through grid search would be necessary to find the value of $n$ that benefits the network the most. It's possible that we stumbled on one of the best values for our softmax decoder. One other caveat is that the effect was not always consistent, and we sometimes observed low accuracies for values of $n$ that had worked well previously. We have included a screenshot of a high accuracy test with the zip file. However, we are unsure why the inconsistence exists."
