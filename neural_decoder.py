    def early_stopping(self, recent_val_losses, curr_val_loss, patience):
        '''Helper method used during training to determine whether training should stop before the maximum number of
        training epochs is reached based on the most recent loss values computed on the validation set
        (`recent_val_losses`) the validation loss on the current epoch (`curr_val_loss`) and `patience`.

        - When training begins, the recent history of validation loss values `recent_val_losses` is empty (i.e. `[]`).
        When we have fewer entries in `recent_val_losses` than the `patience`, then we just insert the current val loss.
        - The length of `recent_val_losses` should not exceed `patience` (only the most recent `patience` loss values
        are considered).
        - The recent history of validation loss values (`recent_val_losses`) is assumed to be a "rolling list" or queue.
        Remove the oldest loss value and insert the current validation loss into the list. You may keep track of the
        full history of validation loss values during training, but maintain a separate list in `fit()` for this.

        Conditions that determine whether to stop training early:
        - We never stop early when the number of validation loss values in the recent history list is less than patience
        (training is just starting out).
        - We stop early when the OLDEST validation loss (`curr_val_loss`) is smaller than all recent validation loss
        values. IMPORTANT: Assume that `curr_val_loss` IS one of the recent loss values â€” so the current loss value
        should be compared with `patience`-1 other loss values.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        recent_val_losses: Python list of floats. len between 0 and `patience` (inclusive).
        curr_val_loss: float. The loss computed on the validation set on the current training epoch.
        patience: int. The patience: how many recent loss values computed on the validation set we should consider when
            deciding whether to stop training early.

        Returns:
        -----------
        recent_val_losses: Python list of floats. len between 1 and `patience` (inclusive).
            The list of recent validation loss values passsed into this method updated to include the current validation
            loss.
        stop. bool. Should we stop training based on the recent validation loss values and the patience value?

        NOTE:
        - This method can be concisely implemented entirely with regular Python (TensorFlow/Numpy not needed).
        - It may be helpful to think of `recent_val_losses` as a queue: the current loss value always gets inserted
        either at the beginning or end. The oldest value is then always on the other end of the list.

    def extract_at_indices(self, x, indices):
        '''Returns the samples in `x` that have indices `indices` to form a mini-batch.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        x: tf.constant. shape=(N, ...). Data samples or labels
        indices: tf.constant. tf.int32, shape=(B,), Indices of samples to return from `x` to form a mini-batch.
            Indices may be in any order, there may be duplicate indices, and B may be less than N (i.e. a mini-batch).
            For example indices could be [0, 1, 2], [2, 2, 1], or [2, 1].
            In the case of [2, 1] this method would samples with index 2 and index 1 (in that order).

        Returns:
        -----------
        tf.constant. shape=(B, ...). Value extracted from `x` whose sample indices are `indices`.

        mini_batch_sz: int. Number of samples to include in each mini-batch.
        lr: float. Learning rate used with Adam optimizer.
        max_epochs: int. Network should train no more than this many epochs (training could stop early).
        patience: int. Number of most recent computations of the validation set loss to consider when deciding whether
            to stop training early (before `max_epochs` is reached).
        val_every: int. How often (in epoches) to compute validation set accuracy, loss, and check whether to stop training
            early.
        verbose: bool. If set to `False`, there should be no print outs during training. Messages indicating start and
        end of training are fine.


        Returns:

        train_loss_hist: Python list of floats. len=num_epochs.
            Training loss computed on each training mini-batch and averaged across all mini-batchs in one epoch.

        num_epochs: int.
            The number of epochs used to train the network. Must be < max_epochs.

        TODO:
        Go through the usual motions:
        - Set up Adam optimizer and loss history tracking containers.
        - In each epoch setup mini-batch. You can sample with replacement or without replacement (shuffle) between epochs
        (your choice).
        - Compute forward pass and loss for each mini-batch. Have your Adam optimizer apply the gradients to update the
        wts and bias.
        - Record the average training loss values across all mini-batches in each epoch.
        - If we're on the first, max, or an appropriate epoch, check the validation set accuracy and loss.
        Check for early stopping with the val loss.
